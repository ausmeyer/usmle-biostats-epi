## Biostatistics

--- &vcenter
## There are some important random terms

> - Generalizability
  - How applicable is result to general population
<br><br>
> - P-value
  - Probability of finding a value this extreme by random chance
<br><br>
> - Confidence Interval
  - Interval over which real population number is found with a specified probability
<br><br>
> - Efficacy
<br><br>
> - Effectiveness

--- &vcenter
## Accuracy is closeness and Precision is repeatability

## Question #1

Investigators are studying prostate specific antigen (PSA) as a predictor of prostate cancer. To make the statistics easier, they are going to assume that PSA is a normally distributed population variable. Which of the following is correct under their assumption?

1. Mode is greater than median
2. Median is greater than mode
3. 95% CI depends on degrees of freedom
4. _Median is equal to mean_
5. Mean is equal to standard deviation

***.hint
The normal distribution is unimodal and symmetric.

***.explanation
The important invariant properties (for you) of normal distributions are the following:

1. Mean = Median = Mode
2. Unimodal
3. Symmetric
4. Area under curve is 1
5. Constant relationship between standard deviation and percentiles

## Question #2

Which of the following corresponds to the measures of central tendency on the graph from **left to right**? 

1. mean, median, mode
2. mode, mean, median
3. median, mode, mean
4. _mode, median, mean_
5. mean, mode, median

 
***=image
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(cowplot)
Mode <- function(x) {
  ux <- unique(x)
  ux[which.max(tabulate(match(x, ux)))]
}
r.skew <- rchisq(100000, df = 5)
ggplot(data.frame(data = r.skew), aes(data)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.4, fill = 'lightgray') + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(r.skew), linetype = 'dotted', lwd = 1) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = median(r.skew), linetype = "dashed", lwd = 1) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = Mode(round(r.skew, digits = 2)), linetype = "solid", lwd = 1) +
  xlim(0, 30) + 
  ylim(0, 6500) +
  ggtitle("") + 
  labs(x="", y="")
```

***.hint
Mode is most common, median is middle, mean is average value.

***.explanation
Always remember that the y-axis on these plots are counts or frequency. Therefore, which line is closest to the peak on the y-axis is the mode. The median is **always** in the middle. The mean is the most susceptible to outliers so in a skewed distribution it will **always** be farthest out on the tail.

## Hypothesis Testing

--- &vcenter
## The null hypothesis (\(H_0\)) is always the default

> - Assuming there are two or more groups being compared...
<br><br><br>
> - \(H_0\): There is no difference in the means of the groups.
<br><br><br>
> - For Step 1, probably safe to assume null is always rejected with \(p < 0.05\).
<br><br><br>
> - \(H_A\): The difference between the means of the groups is real.

## T-test compares means of one or two groups

> - One sample: \(H_0\) = There is no difference between group mean and zero
<br><br>
> - Two sample: \(H_0\) = There is no difference between the disease and control groups
<br><br>

## T-test compares means of one or two groups

 - Two sample: \(H_0\) = There is no difference between the disease and control groups
 <br>
 - Run the t-test
  ```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
  norm1 <- rnorm(5000, mean = 4.75, sd = 1.2)

  (t.test(norm1, norm2))$p.value
  ```
  > - Have we rejected the null hypothesis?
  <br>
  > - Yes, we have accepted \(H_A\). There is a difference between control and disease.

## Chi-squared test uses categorical (count) data

> - Two common tests
 - Test of independence
 - Goodness-of-fit
> - Test of independence
 - \(H_0\): There is no association between the variables under study
 - \(H_A\): There is an association between the variables under study
> - Goodness-of-fit
 - \(H_0\): The number of cases occuring are equal to that expected by chance
 - \(H_A\): The number of cases occuring are unequal to that expected by chance

## Question #3

Investigators developed a new serum biomarker as a predictor for prostate cancer. To test it, they plan a cross-sectional study compromised of two groups. In one group, the researchers will include measurements of men with biopsy confirmed prostate cancer. In the other group, researchers will measure the level of their biomarker in men that have never previously been diagnosed with prostate cancer nor had a positive PSA test. The investigators will assume their biomarker is normally distributed. What is the best test to investigate whether the biomarker can distinguish the two groups?

1. Two sample Mann-Whitney U-test
2. Pearson correlation
3. _Two sample T-test_
4. Chi-squared test
5. Analysis of variance

***.hint
The number of groups and distribution is all that matters

***.explanation
The two sample T-test is the appropriate test in this case. The two sample Mann-Whitney U-test could work as well, but is slightly less efficient for normally distributed data than the T-test. The Pearson correlation requires two measured variables on the same sample. A chi-squared test requires categorical (i.e. count) data. An analysis of variance is typically used to measure the difference in means of three or more groups.

  - Given a __defined period of time__ and an at-risk population
  - Number of people with disease / Number of people who are exposed

> - Prevalence
  - Given an at-risk population
  - __No time frame__

***.hint
Question prefaces a positive test result

***.explanation
1. Incorrect - Moving the line to the right increases the specificity because it captures more true negatives as a portion of total negative individuals
2. Incorrect - Moving the line to the right decreases the sensitivity because it captures fewer true positives as a portion of total positive individuals
3. Correct - Moving the line to the right increase positive predictive value drives up the portion of true positives to total positive test by reducing the number of false positives
4. Incorrect - The question is concerned about positives tests which do not factor into negative predictive value
5. Incorrect - The question is concerned about positives tests which do not factor into negative predictive value

## Question #5

Investigators are studying the association between mesothelioma and asbestos exposure. Due to the relative rarity of the disease, they design a very large case-control study. In the end, they find an \(OR = 20 (19.54;20.52, p < 0.001)\). After assuming that the OR is a good approximation of risk, the authors conclude that the risk of mesothelioma is 20 times higher in those exposed to asbestos compared to control. Why is their assumption reasonable?

1. _The incidence of mesothelioma in the population is low_
2. The sample size of this study is very large
3. The result is highly significant
4. The OR is always a good approximation of outcome risk
5. The 95% CI is very narrow around the OR of 20
